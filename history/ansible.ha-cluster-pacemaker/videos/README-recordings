== Howto for recodings ==
Below is procedure for making recordings of this role.
Any recording should be done using asciinema v2 format.

1. Have some machine that will be executing the commands.
I will use remote machine (VM) in this procedure - 192.168.34.62

2. Copy all scripts that will be used to machine user 'user'

3. Make sure that:
  - you can login to machine as 'user' without password
  - user 'user' on machine can login without password to all future cluster nodes (needed for ansible)
  - machine contains /etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key

4. Run recording using command below.
  # asciinema rec default_playbook-recording -c "ssh user@192.168.34.62 bash script.sh"

5. Edit recording file to make sure that timings are not too long.
(it is borring to look at non-moving output for long time)
